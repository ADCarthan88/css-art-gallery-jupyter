# 🎨 CSS Art Gallery (Jupyter Edition)

Welcome to the **CSS Art Gallery**, a creative fusion of HTML, CSS, and Jupyter Notebook workflows. This project showcases visually stunning, hand-crafted designs built entirely with front-end code—no images, no SVGs, just pure CSS magic.

## 🌟 Live Demo

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main gallery page with embedded CSS art
- `styles.css` – Custom styling and animations
- `aurora.dream`, `glass-poem` – Experimental design snippets
- Hosted and previewed via Jupyter Notebook for rapid iteration

## 🧠 Inspiration
This project was born from a desire to push the boundaries of CSS and explore artistic expression through code. Each piece reflects a blend of geometry, gradients, and animation—crafted with precision and a touch of whimsy.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Keyframes, Gradients)
- Jupyter Notebook (for local preview and experimentation)

## 🔒 Security Awareness
